# Premier Model Website

This project is currently under development. I am still working on building its features, so some parts may be incomplete or not fully functional at the moment.

## Features So Far
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Fashion Showcase**: Displays models with images and videos.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Users can browse through various model categories.
- **Alphabet Filter**: Allows navigation through models by their names.

## Features to Come
- **Detailed Model Pages**: Individual model profiles with more information.
- **Advanced Filtering Options**: Search and filter models by categories like agency, gender, etc.
- **Improved Animations and Interactions**: Additional enhancements to make the website more dynamic.

## Current Status
**This project is not fully completed**. I am actively working on adding new features and making improvements. 

Stay tuned for updates!
