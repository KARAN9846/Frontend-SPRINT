This repository is dedicated to providing a series of short, simple, and practical examples for learning frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each example is focused on a specific topic, making it easy to grasp core concepts quickly and effectively.

## Objective
The main goal of this repository is to help developers—especially beginners—enhance their frontend skills by practicing basic to intermediate concepts. By keeping the examples straightforward and easy to understand, learners can quickly apply the knowledge in real-world projects.

## Key Concepts Covered
- HTML structure and elements
- CSS positioning (`absolute`, `relative`, etc.)
- Background properties and styling
- Essential JavaScript interactivity (coming soon)

## Why This Approach?
Frontend development can be overwhelming with the abundance of information available. This project breaks down complex concepts into bite-sized, manageable examples that are easy to follow. This sprint-based approach to learning encourages consistency and gradual improvement.

## How to Use
Explore the examples within the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and try to modify them to better understand the effects. This is designed for self-paced learning, so you can revisit any concept as needed.
